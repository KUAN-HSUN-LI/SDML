# Generating graph embeddings with node2vec

## usage

1. Put your embedding file generated by node2vec algorithm in ```./```, with filename ```cit.emb```. 

   For usage of node2vec you can refer to ```README.md``` in ```./node2vec_python```

   format:

```
nodeid1 vector1
nodeid2 vector2
...
```

2. Run ```generate_node_vec.py``` and it will generate a pickle file ```node_vec.pkl```. 

   It contains a torch tensor with shape ```(7000, 24)```, where 24 is the current dimension of the node vectors.
